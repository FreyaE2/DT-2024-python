# Tracking what I did each day

**26/06** - I started to research easygui, this is what I got from the tutorials:

My code:

**31/07** - I have begun to start my actual code, i moved to tkinter as there are more tutorials and through reading I found it easier to use on RepLit. This code is me figuring out design, buttons and placement

(if exit is clicked the program will destroy itself)

(The dictionary is a test one at the moment)

**02/08**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f0adc2e-bccd-477d-8fbc-c92d04cf9751)
Code to define when the "in stock" button is clicked

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcb30847-45ac-4d45-8951-43171f73f979)
When it's clicked this is what will show up, I now want to try to change the window colour and make the "in stock" more of a list instead of a row.

I have done all the demo's for each button, now I have got to refine them and add real music

**18/09**
Had to debug, the words would dissapear outside the window and wouldnt show, had to figure out how to make a list
Firstly I wanted to change the layout to what I had originally planned (Horizontal) so thats what I did (I used my old tests and research to figure out how to do it)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1ea50b8-91d4-424e-b9b9-c3f8cac71543)
Code to align buttons (pady and padx is what I was missing)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c772e65-8064-4e68-807d-e8c0ae019d09)
Button positions now

Then I had to sort out how to make my songs into a list, I wanted it to be a dictionary type thing that the program could read from

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf42439b-d9ac-47ef-b69e-195e0d927d0c)
Code for the list (and names for the on loan list (fake names for now))

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6575f915-a4e1-42a0-9984-4ca8950d3b32)
Code for reading from the list (a lot of google research, videos and tutorials to find this)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1ef7de8-2b54-4f3d-91c5-849e18d1c1a0)
What it looks like now when the button is pressed

The webpage is finally coming together and it is what i wanted it to look like, I need to tweak a few things and add names now.
