# Tracking what I did each day

**26/06** - I started to research easygui, this is what I got from the tutorials:

My code:

**31/07** - I have begun to start my actual code, i moved to tkinter as there are more tutorials and through reading I found it easier to use on RepLit. This code is me figuring out design, buttons and placement

(if exit is clicked the program will destroy itself)

(The dictionary is a test one at the moment)

**02/08** Just more additions to my code to make it more like my first plan

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f0adc2e-bccd-477d-8fbc-c92d04cf9751)

Code to define when the "in stock" button is clicked

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcb30847-45ac-4d45-8951-43171f73f979)

When it's clicked this is what will show up, I now want to try to change the window colour and make the "in stock" more of a list instead of a row.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/998378c3-5463-4c5e-bba7-f910aafbe5b0)

I have done all the demo's for each button, now I have got to refine them and add real music

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/639ca45c-30fb-4090-a38e-22c0bb7cd627)

**18/09** Had to debug, the words would dissapear outside the window and wouldnt show, had to figure out how to make a list

Firstly I wanted to change the layout to what I had originally planned (Horizontal) so thats what I did (I used my old tests and research to figure out how to do it)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1ea50b8-91d4-424e-b9b9-c3f8cac71543)

Code to align buttons (pady and padx is what I was missing)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c772e65-8064-4e68-807d-e8c0ae019d09)

Button positions now

**20/09** Then I had to sort out how to make my songs into a list, I wanted it to be a dictionary type thing that the program could read from so I found out how to actaully code that and how I could make sure when the window is opened those songs would appear

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf42439b-d9ac-47ef-b69e-195e0d927d0c)

Code for the list (and names for the on loan list (fake names for now))

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6575f915-a4e1-42a0-9984-4ca8950d3b32)

Code for reading from the list

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1ef7de8-2b54-4f3d-91c5-849e18d1c1a0)

What it looks like now when the button is pressed

The webpage is finally coming together and it is what i wanted it to look like, I need to tweak a few things and add names now.

**25/09** I started to add the list of songs I wanted into the list but they ended up showing outside the screen

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83f70266-cc7c-49ba-ac26-a1dc14927974)

Showing the names being cut off

This made me realise that I would need to add a scroll bar into it

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a81e501-5c81-462c-9818-2def6707e6b2)

First test of the scroll bar (have to edit code later)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36ad7de4-921b-4397-acfe-a9e5c4c31869)

And this is what it ended up like, this meant I could scroll and see all the names

The only issue is that when it's put into full screen it looks weird but for now this is good

When the window is in full screen
