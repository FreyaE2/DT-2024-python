This is plan #1, it includes three main buttons - Items, On Loan and Over plus a smaller exit button in the corner, clicking on them would open a seperate window with the information.

This is plan #2, instead of having the buttons it would just have the lists there, clicking on the title would full screen it to show the whole screen with all the information

After I went through and tested some conponents, I used draw.io to come up with a final design which would look like the image below
